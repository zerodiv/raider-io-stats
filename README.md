Notes for later:

Want to build out 'favord' group comps:

We will need to lookup the individual runs, this will be -huge- crawl
(class * specs * 10k characters * 9 dungeon crawls a piece)

However, if we collapse the storage for it to one spot, the runs should have overlap due to us
fetching all the people in a group at a time. Need to do the actual math when not tired.
